# Call for Extended Abstracts

TBD

## Submission

TBD

## Format

Abstracts are strictly one page long (a second page may only contain the references) and we recommend using [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/bias-abstract-template/gspwbcmpxgkv). Abstracts must be submitted in PDF format, and the review will be single-blind. We expect a brief description of the work including context, methodology and (potentially preliminary) results.

## Presentation Format

TBD
